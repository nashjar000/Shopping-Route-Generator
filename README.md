This is a shopping route generator that I made to learn about java script. I was thinking about my in-person trips to Walmart and realized that if I started in the Z ailes, and loop around the store to aile A, I can get the frozen prducts last and not need to worry about them melting while grabbing everything else.

things to improve on: see if I can get a Walmart API to link this with a shopping cart if that's possbile.
